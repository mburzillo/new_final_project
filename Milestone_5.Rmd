# Summary of Trounstine (2016)

Trounstine's [*Segregation and Inequality in Public Goods*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12227) attempts to explain differences in public goods provision and political polarization through a racial lens by examining the relationships between polarization, goods provision, and segregation. Trounstine measures segregation with Theil's H index, which measures the degree to which the diversity of a neighborhood differs from the diversity of the entire city. The main finding of the paper is that segregation, not simply diversity or political views, is an important determinant of both political polarization and spending on public goods. In general, segregation leads to the coincidence of racial and spatial political cleavages, which can make compromise on taxation and public spending difficult and tends to generally drive down the rate of spending on public goods. Because minorities are much more likely to live in racially segregated areas than whites, this suggests that public goods are also segregated across racial lines. 

The first set of analyses that Trounstine runs assess the ability of segregation as measured by both a multigroup and two-group Theil's H Index to explain political polarization. A varitey of demographic controls and controls for election characteristics (e.g. Biracial contest v. not) are included. The exact model Trounstine employs is a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression with fixed effects for region and year and with ransom effects for cities. In the third specification of the model, Trounstine also includes a control for white ideology. 

The second set of analyses looks at the ability of segregation as measured by the two-group measure of segregation to explain overall per capita city expenditures. Trounstine uses linear regressions with fixed effects for cities and robust standard errors clustered by city in this set of models. In the first model, Trounstine regresses direct general expenditure per capita on the segregation variable with controls. Then, changes the model controls for percent Black, Asian, and Latino residents to the 5 year changes in Black, Asian, and Latino residents. In the third specification, Trounstine adds controls for mean ideology of the city residents to the model from the first specification in the table. Finally, Trounstine also performs the same regression with the basic controls 6 more times, with public spending on roads, law enforcement, parks, sewers, housing/welfare and then own source revenue as the dependent variables. 

Since the results suggested that more diverse communities were associated with higher overall levels of spending, Trounstine next sought to assess the relationships between increasing segregation, diversity and public spending. To do this, Trounstine divided the sample of city-years by quintiles of percent nonwhite and re-estimated the first of the regression models using segregation to explain public expenditures. Then, keeping all of the other variables at their mean values in the given quantile, she predicted the direct general expenditure per capita at the minimum and maximum levels of segregation for the quintile and took their difference. The results suggested that direct general expenditure declines as segregation increases no matter the original size of the minority population.  

Finally, Trounstine uses an instrumental variable for the number of waterways to address concerns about the causal relationship between segregation and spending (e.g. the concern that some third variable is affecting both segregation and spending or vice versa and that the effect is not causal). She performs the same analyses to estimate the effects of the number of waterways on total public spending and public spending on specific goods. However, Trounstine does not add fixed effects at the city level since the number of waterways is constant in the dataset. Instead, she uses fixed effects for region and year. Trounstine also adds a lagged version of the dependent variable because there is a high correlation between observations over time for the same city and because local budgets change incrementally from previous years. She uses two-stage ordinary least squares for her model. In the first stage, Trounstine includes logged population as an instrument because people have tended to settle near water and thus large, older cities that have typically been more highly segregated tend to have more waterways.

The results of all of the various specifications that Trounstine runs suggest that segregation has an important negative impact on public spending and political polarization in cities, and that increased political polarization may be the mechanism through which segregation leads to the negative impacts on public spending.
